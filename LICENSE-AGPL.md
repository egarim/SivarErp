## About the GNU Affero General Public License

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version on a publicly accessible server gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.

3. Any software that uses this code must also be released under the AGPL and make its source code available.
